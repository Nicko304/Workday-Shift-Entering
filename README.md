# Workday-Shift-Entering

A project with the end-goal of automating the process of entering shift times from a timecard onto Workday to increase worker efficiency and accuracy at my current workplace.

# Requirements

- Selenium.
- Chromedriver file.
- Edit line 17 with the appropriate file path for your Chromedriver.

# Instructions
1. Complete the setup indicated on the code file and have selenium installed.
2. Run the program and respond to each of the three prompts given.
3. Login to your USC account and complete DUO 2FA once the program takes you to the site.
4. Let the program do the rest and it should do nothing after entering the shift.

# Disclaimers

- This project is incomplete, but it will still run properly (it only supports entering one shift per run of the program and may contain bugs.
- There is also a lack of user testing so please read the prompts carefully when running the program to reduce errors.
